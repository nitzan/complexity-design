The world is changing exponentially, but are we designing linearly? In the age of abundant connectivity, how might we move from thinking in terms of simple objects to thinking in dynamic systems?

How can we start designing for the outcomes that were normally considered as too complex to achieve? How can we navigate the intention, context, and outcome of emerging complex artifacts like AI, memes, deep fakes, and resistance movements?
